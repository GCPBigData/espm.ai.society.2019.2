[Verse 1]
Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now, you should have somehow realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now


[Verse 2]
Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now


[Pre-Chorus]
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how


[Chorus]
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall


[Verse 3]
Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow realised what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now


[Pre-Chorus]
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how


[Chorus]
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall


[Outro]
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me


[Instrumental Outro]


[Verse 1]
How many special people change?
How many lives are living strange?
Where were you while we were getting high?


Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?


[Chorus]
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky


[Verse 2]
Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye


Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?


[Chorus]
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova


[Bridge]
'Cause people believe
That they're gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning 'round, we don't know why
Why? Why? Why? Why?


[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
How many special people change?
How many lives are living strange?
Where were you while we were getting high?


Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?


[Verse 1]
I need to be myself
I can't be no-one else
I'm feeling supersonic, give me gin and tonic
You can have it all, but how much do you want it?
You make me laugh
Give me your autograph
Can I ride with you in your BMW?
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine


[Pre-Chorus 1]
You need to find out
'Cause no-one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you want to say
But before tomorrow


[Chorus]
'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call
Nobody can ever hear him call


[Verse 2]
You need to be yourself
You can't be no-one else
I know a girl called Elsa, she's into Alka-Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train
And she makes me laugh
I got her autograph
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter
She's sniffing in a tissue selling the Big Issue


[Pre-Chorus 2]
When she finds out
No-one's gonna tell her what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you want to say
But before tomorrow


[Chorus]
'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call
Nobody can ever hear him call


[Verse 1]
Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday
I've got a lot of things to learn
Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
Before my heart starts to burn


[Bridge]
So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away


[Verse 2]
Times are hard when things have got no meaning
I've found a key upon the floor
Maybe you and I will not believe in
The things we find behind the door


[Bridge]
So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away


[Chorus 1]
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows, the way it's gonna be


[Verse 3]
If you're leaving will you take me with you?
I'm tired of talking on my phone
There is one thing I can never give you
My heart will never be your home


[Bridge]
So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away


[Chorus 1]
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows, the way it's gonna be


[Bridge 2]
The way it's gonna be, yeah
Maybe I can see, yeah
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away (hey, hey)


[Chorus 2]
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows
Yeah, God only knows, the way it's gonna be


[Verse 1]
Slide away and give it all you've got
My today fell in from the top
I dream of you and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now


[Verse 2]
Hold me down all the world's asleep
Need you now you've knocked me off my feet
I dream of you and we talk of growing old
But you said "Please don't!"


[Pre-Chorus]
Slide in baby, together we'll fly
I've tried praying
But I don't know what you're saying to me


[Chorus 1]
Now that you're mine
We'll find a way
Of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning we don't know what to do
Two of a kind
We'll find a way
To do what we've done
Let me be the one who shines with you
And we can slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Away


[Verse 1]
Slide away and give it all you've got
My today fell in from the top
I dream of you and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now


[Pre-Chorus]
Slide in baby, together we'll fly
I've tried praying
And I know just what you're saying to me


[Chorus 2]
Now that you're mine
We'll find a way
Of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning we don't know what to do
We're two of a kind
We'll find a way
To do what we've done
Oh, let me be the one who shines with you
And we can slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)


[Verse 1]
Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Slowly fade away


[Pre-Chorus]
So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out


[Chorus]
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say


[Verse 2]
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock 'n' roll band
Who'll throw it all away


[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out


[Chorus]
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say


[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say


[Outro]
So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger
I heard you say
At least not today [Verse 1]
Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?


[Chorus 1]
Maybe I just wanna fly
Wanna live, I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever


[Verse 2]
I said maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?


[Chorus 2]
Maybe I will never be
All the things that I wanna be
Now is not the time to cry
Now's the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever


[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 1]
Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone


[Chorus 1]
Maybe I just wanna fly
Wanna live, I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever


[Outro]
Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever


[Verse 1]
Hold up
Hold on
Don't be scared
You'll never change what's been and gone
May your smile (may your smile)
Shine on (shine on)
Don't be scared (don't be scared)
Your destiny may keep you warm


[Chorus]
'Cause all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them someday
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out


[Verse 2]
Get up (get up)
Come on (come on)
Why're you scared? (I'm not scared)
You'll never change
What's been and gone


[Chorus]
'Cause all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them someday
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out


[Chorus]
'Cause all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them someday
Just take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out


[Outro]
We're all of us stars
We're fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see us someday
Just take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out


[Verse 1]
All your dreams are made
When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade
Today's the day that all the world will see
Another sunny afternoon
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune
Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon


[Chorus]
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to rest your mind
You know you should so I guess you might as well


[Post-Chorus]
What's the story morning glory?
Well?
You need a little time to wake up wake up
Well?
What's the story morning glory?
Well?
Need a little time to wake up wake up


[Verse 2]
All your dreams are made
When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade
Today's the day that all the world will see
Another sunny afternoon
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune
Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon


[Chorus]
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to rest your mind
You know you should so I guess you might as well


[Post-Chorus]
What's the story morning glory?
Well?
You need a little time to wake up wake up
Well?
What's the story morning glory?
Well?
Need a little time to wake up wake up
Well?
What's the story morning glory?
Well?
Need a little time to wake up wake up
Well?
What's the story morning glory?
Well?
Need a little time to wake up wake up


[Verse 1]
Take the time to make some sense
Of what you want to say
And cast your words away upon the waves
Sail them home with acquiesce
On a ship of hope today
And as they land upon the shore
Tell them not to fear no more
Say it loud and sing it proud today
And then


[Chorus 1]
Dance if you wanna dance
Please brother take a chance
You know they're gonna go
Which way they wanna go
All we know is that we don't know
How it's gonna be
Please brother let it be
Life on the other hand
Won't make us understand
We're all part of a masterplan



Say it loud and sing it proud today


[Verse 2]
I'm not saying right is wrong
It's up to us to make
The best of all the things that come our way
'Cause everything that's been has passed
The answer's in the looking glass
There's four and twenty million doors
On life's endless corridor
Say it loud and sing it proud
And they


[Chorus 2]
Will dance if they wanna dance
Please brother take a chance
You know they're gonna go
Which way they wanna go
All we know is that we don't know
How it's gonna be
Please brother let it be
Life on the other hand
Won't make you understand
We're all part of a masterplan


[Verse 1]
I would like to leave this city
This old town don't smell too pretty and
I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind
And when I leave this island
I'll book myself into a soul asylum
'Cause I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind


[Chorus]
So here I go
Still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that were mine anyway
You're half the world away
Half the world away



[Post-Chorus]
Half the world away
I've been lost I've been found but I don't feel down


[Verse 2]
And when I leave this planet
You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and
I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind
And if I could leave this spirit
I'll find me a hole and I'll live in it and
I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind


[Chorus]
Here I go
Still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that were mine anyway
You're half the world away
Half the world away



[Post-Chorus]
Half the world away
I've been lost I've been found but I don't feel down


[Outro]
No I don't feel down
No I don't feel down
I don't feel down
I don't feel down
Don't feel down
I don't feel down


[Verse 1]
A cold and frosty morning there's not a lot to say
About the things caught in my mind
And as the day was dawning my plane flew away
With all the things caught in my mind


[Pre-Chorus]
I do wanna be there when you're... coming down
I do wanna be there when you hit the ground


[Chorus 1]
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and today
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right


[Verse 2]
Damn, my situation, and the games I have to play
With all the things caught in my mind
Damn, my education, I can't find the words to say
With all the things caught in my mind


[Pre-Chorus]
I do wanna be there when you're... coming down
And I do wanna be there when you hit the ground


[Chorus 1]
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and today
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right


[Middle 8]
Me and you, what's going on?
All we seem to know is how to show
The feelings that are wrong


[Chorus 1]
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and today
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right


[Chorus 2]
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and today
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
Yes I need more time
Just to make things right


[Outro]
So don't go away
